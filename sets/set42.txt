Leave a jest when it pleases you best.
Envy takes no holiday.
Forget other faults remembering your own
Forgive and forget.
A friend is known in adversity, like gold is known in fire
Don't have too many irons in the fire.
A wise enemy as a companion is better than a foolish friend.
The great folks and dogs know no relationship.
