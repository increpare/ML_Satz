Make a virtue out of necessity.
Don't spit where you need to drink.
A bad bush is better than no shelter
Every hair casts its shadow
There is no little enemy.
One nail drives out another.
It is better to be alone than to be in bad company.
When the pig is proffered, hold up the poke.
Cats hide their claws.
