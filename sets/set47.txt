We are all descended from Adam.
The remedy is worse than the cure.
He lacks not comfort who enjoys a contended mind.
None is so deaf as the one who will not hear.
The smaller the company, the better the share; the bigger the company, the merrier the play.
The little hemlock is a sister to the big hemlock.
Once a drunkard always a drunkard.
When the cat's away, the mice will play.
Where force rules, justice does not exist.
Unseriousness eats pumpkin leaves.
One frog spoilt all the water.
Age and poverty are ill to bear.
The mouth is not satisfied until it has tasted cow
