United we stand, divided we fall
Cast no dirt into the well that gives you water.
 Easy come, easy go.
  Sell not the bear's skin before you have caught him.
  Birds fly not into our mouth ready roasted.
  A blind man shoots sometimes a crow.
  He that would eat the kernel must crack the nut.
  God is with those who persevere
  Persevere and never fear.
  He that would eat the kernel must crack the nut.
