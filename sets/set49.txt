The apple does not fall far from the tree.
All good things are three.
You must not run after two hares at the same time.
It is an ill bird that fouls its own nest
Don't wash your dirty linen in public.
God gave us two ears and one mouth.
Give him an inch and he will take a yard.
He that will not work, shall not eat.
The shoemaker goes barefoot.
Never is a long time.
Just as one calls into the forest, so it echoes back.
Like mother, like daughter.
Like father, like son.
If the shoe fits, wear it.
Two is a crowd, but three is a company.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
Death before dishonour.
Time is money.
Men are like fish; the great ones devour the small.
All that glimmers is not gold.
Fine words butters no parsnips.
Reckless youth makes rueful age.
Heaven helps those who help themselves.
Dry bread at home is better than roast meat abroad.
Dog doesn't eat dog.
A good marksman may miss.
