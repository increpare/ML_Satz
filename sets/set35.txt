Silence gives consent.
God's mills grind slowly, but for sure.
The more the merrier.
Never put off till tomorrow what can be done today.
Give a finger, he will take whole arm.
Everyone is creator of his own fortune.
What you reap is what you sow.
A bad compromise is better than a good lawsuit.
There are no cakes without work.
 A covetous man does nothing that he should till he dies
 Love goes through the stomach.
 He who perservers shall win.
 Not seeing the forest for the trees.
 Wise men learn by other men's mistakes, fools by their own.
 You might as well try to hold an eel by the tail.
 Tell the story from the beginning.
 The fault was committed in the bush, but it is now talked about on the highway.
