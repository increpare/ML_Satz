Fortune favours the foolish.
Discretion is better than valour.
The cow licks the one which licks it.
Fortune never comes twice.
Wealth is short-lived.
Men try to hide their sorrow.
The way a man dies is determined by his occupation.
Necessity knows no law.
Do not abuse the hospitality of others.
Each man must recognize his faults.
Virtue is not lost with age.
