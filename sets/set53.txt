A frog in a well does not know the great ocean
Who chases two rabbits catches neither
The fallen blossom returns not to the bough
Good medicine is bitter to the mouth.
To kill a bull by straightening its horns.
To continue is power.
A bat in a village without birds.
 There are hardships and there are delights.
  When poisoned, one might as well swallow the plate.
  Early rising benefits you three pence.
  If you're going to eat pork, eat it till your mouth drips
   After rain comes fair weather; March winds and April showers bring forth May flowers.
   In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
    Perfect is the enemy of good.
    Early rising benefits you three pence.
    The early bird gets the worm
    The early one wins.
    First come, first served;
    Faith can move mountains.
     Even a solitary mutter in a well is known after three years.
     Wisdom gotten from age is better than the shell of a tortoise.
Years know more than books.
Experience is the mother of wisdom.
Prudence is the footprint of Wisdom.
One blind man leads the crowd.
If the blind leads the blind, they both fall into the ditch.
A fool always finds one still more foolish to admire him.
A fool always finds a greater fool to admire him.
It is dark one inch ahead of you.
Who can see in the future?
Expect the unexpected.
The nail that sticks out gets hammered down.
If you do not enter the tiger's cave, you will not catch its cub.
Fall down seven times, get up eight
The talented hawk hides its claws.
In wine there is truth
 The eyes are sometimes a true index of the heart.
water under the bridge
