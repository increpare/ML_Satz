An old dog barks not in vain.
A wolf will not break a wolf.
The wolf breaks the counted sheep.
All that glimmers is not gold.
Such mother, such daughter.
The apple never falls far form the tree.
No dreaming cat catches mice.
The apple does not fall far from the tree.
A little fish is supper for a large fish.
The carpenter's wife has no batler, the smith's wife has no hatchet.
It is good fishing in streamy water.
A lie has short legs.
Don't sell the skin till you have caught the bear.
Don't make an ox out of a fly.
