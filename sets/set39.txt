Men are like fish; the great ones devour the small.
A good horse is a member of the family.
 Love is a slippery game.
 Love is a risky game.
 Blind dogs hunting deer.
 A pot of gold is needed to keep the gifts from loneliness
 A shameless person will be happy with a thorny tree on his backside
 The child died calling out for water when he spoke persian in Punjab
