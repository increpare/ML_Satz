A wise man hears one word and understands two.
After death, a person is holy.
A tree doesn't fall with one blow.
Don't pour oil on fire.
Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.
When one lives, one experiences.
If a stone stays in one place, it becomes overgrown with grass.
You can't make a shtreimel from a pig's tail.
Man plans and God laughs.
