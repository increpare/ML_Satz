Unused firewood mocks the burning wood.
One can cause the illness which he wanted to cure.
To strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.
We are to learn as long as we live.
A colt you may break but an old horse you never can.
'Tis in vain to kick after you have once put on fetters.
Great braggers little doers.
He that knows least commonly presumes most.
No pride like that of an enriched beggar.
Good deeds remain, all things else perish.
Be slow to promise and quick to perform.
They talk like angels but live like men.
They say that the best counsel is that of woman
No one knows the weight of anothes burden.
Vows made in storms are forgotten in calms.
Do all you can and leave the rest to providence.
A truth teller finds the doors closed against him.
A fox should not be of the jury at a goose's trial.
Burn not your house to fright away the mice.
Misfortunes come by forties.
Death meets us everywhere.
As a man lives so shall he die. 
As a tree falls so shall it lie.â€Ž
