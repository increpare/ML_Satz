Even if you know the way, ask one more time.
An empty cart rattles loudly.
In a place where there is will, there is a road.
Beans come out from where beans are planted
Birds listen to day-words and rats listen to night-words.
After three years at a village schoolhouse, even a dog can recite a poem.
Don't try to cover the whole sky with the palm of your hand.
 Even monkeys may fall from trees.
