Birds of a feather flock together.
Adversity is the mother of wisdom.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
A friend is known in adversity, like gold is known in fire.
A mountain never meets a mountain, but a man meets a man.
Slow and steady wins the race.
A blind man should not judge of colours.
Like father, like son.
Like mother, like daughter.
If life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
Advice most needed are the least heeded.
If the cat is away, the mice play.
Make haste slowly.
Thou shalt not steal
Nobody can serve two masters.
All that glisters is not gold.
Cobblers' children are worst shod.
Learn to walk before you can run.
He that will not work, shall not eat.
