The trick the father has, the son has.
There was often a bad cloth on a tailor and a bad shoe on a cobbler.
Every beginning is weak.
Walls have ears.
The people meet each other but the hills do not.
It is a third of the work to begin.
In at one ear and out at the other.
The little fish feed the big fish.
A fool's money is not long in his pocket.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Things aren't as they seem.
Sense does not come before age.
The well fed person doesn't understand the hungry one.
There is no woman more accustomed to bad shoes on her than the cobbler's wife.
A good word never broke a tooth.
