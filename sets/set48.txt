God gave teeth, God will provide the bread.
Each day brings it own bread.
It is good fishing in streamy water.
It is good fishing in troubled waters.
Well begun, is half done.
Just as one calls into the forest, so it echoes back.
What kind of parents, such children.
If the shoe fits, wear it.
He who does not want to work, that cannot eat either.
He that will not work, shall not eat.
Cat patting leads to hump raising.
The more you stroke the cat's tail, the more he raises his back.
Such father, such son.
Like father, like son.
Constant dropping wears the stone.
Misfortune comes on horseback and goes away on foot.
Don't sell the skin till you have caught the bear.
Measure thrice, cut once.
All that glimmers is not gold.
The apple does not fall far from the tree.
An old love does not rust.
The shoemaker is always barefooted.
The shoemaker goes barefoot.
Dry bread at home is better than roast meat abroad.
Crows do not pick out crows' eyes.
Men are like fish; the great ones devour the small.
