The moon does not feel a burden of his knowledge.
Hit the iron while it is time to answer.
Fortune is never lost.
Faith is half gotten.
A child's heart and hands are the deepest.
Caution is the architect of his knowledge.
Idle hands are soon filled.
Salt doesn't injure the heart, there is truth.
Good wine needs no colors.
The devil is blind.
Long hair and short tongue.
A great dowry is a good horse.
Jest with an egg.
Don't sit in a hurry.
Mischiefs come by the horns.
If you're a liar, you better prepare the stick.
The best cloth may have blessed effects.
Every why has its own roots.
Stubborn as a babe unborn.
Old birds are not cleaned every day.

A cheerful wife is poison to him.
A stranger is blind even when the cat eats.
The pig is the prick's sweetmeat.
Diseases are the ones with good intentions.
Necessity knows no one.
Stubborn as a reward.
The sea gives, the sea who has no guilt.
